This project is a comprehensive web application developed during the AICP 8-Weeks Internship Program. The application focuses on providing functionalities for user registration, business listings, and advanced search capabilities, with an emphasis on front-end development using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Users can register, log in, and log out using responsive forms styled with CSS and validated with JavaScript to ensure proper input handling, including checks for valid email formats and password strength. A profile management page allows users to update their details such as name, email, and city, with data stored in the browser's local storage for persistence.
The application features a home screen displaying categories like Food, Healthcare, Hotels, and Education, dynamically populated using JavaScript from static data. Each category links to sub-category pages, which further list businesses with placeholders that include thumbnails, names, and brief descriptions. Business details pages provide comprehensive information such as address, contact details, and services offered. A review and rating system allows users to submit feedback and view average ratings for businesses. Additionally, a search functionality enables users to search for businesses by name or category, with real-time filtered results displayed dynamically.
Advanced features include multi-criteria filtering for search results based on location, category, sub-category, and popularity. Users can refine their searches and apply multiple filters simultaneously. Price-related functionalities, such as a slider input for filtering businesses by price range, enhance the user experience. Bootstrap has been utilized to ensure responsive design, providing a mobile-first approach and improved user interface for business detail cards.
Throughout the development, unit tests were performed to ensure the accuracy of features, such as form validation, profile update functionality, business listing display, review submission, and search filters. The project serves as a robust platform for demonstrating skills in web development and user-centric design, with future possibilities for integrating backend systems for enhanced data persistence and security.
